! helo!
# anwayy it is the case that it was that same night that i totof i need to do monoreps even though they are inferior. else will litter my profile page which if it doesnt then can consider whether still gonna monorep due to other gh limitations
- <r>decided will od this now cos even if i dun do and jsut start recollectoin now there si high chance i wun be able to complete it, adn en come back next episode cont, might as well spend some of the work to be done invest it in getting a UI that can allow mroe total work done by next episode</r>
-- <r>r is syntax to preredact</r>
- the table idea anyway only tot of that ytd, ll long time ago tot of that before
# so really too often need to write commit msg before commit, tho ml long ago alreayd knew this. anyway shld come up w a syntax for it todo[]
# re p-commit, hell it seems liek i should just redefine the ! and - such that the - is simply defined as a publication todo[think]
# so one thing i cant do is tht i cant start a new groupcommit while inside a groupcommit. thus todo[]possibly come up with a syntax to do that. and nowtyping i jus gonna branch
- caps looks better + forgotten about foobar
# need to undo an item in this file so need change syntax done[]
# os jus now on train to sf i tot o fwhat syntax to use for allowing writing commitmsgs before commit is done, and dn tot of tat can try using appending a YET behind. which woudl mean it would sitll be editing until the YET is removed. and wiht thsi syntax i no longer need ot associate the typedhalfway msgs with the previous msg until their complete, or to associate them with a comment. o yea at that time i also toto fhtat i need a gd syntax to be able to do multiline comments. as i would nede tomimpokrt stfuf taht is writtne earlier in . and when thinkign fo that i toto f that fking hell acutlalwy there need tnot be any linakges ebtwen the multiline comemnts and the single lines comemnts, taht it tis he cas erthat in can be using two diferetn types of suyntaxes fo rthem and this is mst new as i dun beelive anyone ot o  foit before, and also new to me.:
